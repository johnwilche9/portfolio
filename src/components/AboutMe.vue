            I am currently serving as an SK councilor at Barangay Pilipog while pursuing a BSIT degree.  In tandem with my academic pursuits, I sought to augment my skill set through practical training. My tenure at TESDA CCA training, where I completed a Creative Web Design course, served as a testament to my dedication to continuous learning. And right now I'm taking Computer System Servicing NC II. Furthermore, I have consistently received honors from elementary school to grade 11. I am also a hardworking individual and I possess strong leadership skills, demonstrated through my ability to motivate and guide teams toward achieving their goals.
